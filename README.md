# Image-Steganography
Image Steganography using python

Image steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within an image in such a way that the hidden data is kept secret. This technique is used to ensure secure communication by embedding messages in digital images without showing their physical appearance.


Libraries Used: 
PIL (Python Imaging Library) : A Python Imaging Library fork used for image processing tasks.
Cryptography: A Python library used for encryption and decryption of the hidden message
